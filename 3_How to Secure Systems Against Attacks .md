## 3. How to Secure Systems Against Attacks

DevSecOps secures systems by automating security controls across the development pipeline:

### During Development (Dev)

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** to detect insecure code
* **Dependency scanning** to identify vulnerable libraries
* **Secure coding practices** and code reviews

### During CI/CD Pipeline

* **Automated security testing** (SAST, DAST, SCA)
* **Secrets management** (no hard-coded credentials)
* **Pipeline access control and audit logging**

### During Deployment & Operations (Ops)

* **Container security** (image scanning, runtime protection)
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning**
* **Network segmentation and firewalls**
* **Continuous monitoring and logging**

### Continuous Improvement

* **Automated patching and updates**
* **Incident response automation**
* **Regular security training for teams**
