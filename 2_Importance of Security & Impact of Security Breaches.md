## 2. Importance of Security & Impact of Security Breaches

### Importance of Security

In DevSecOps, security is critical because modern applications are cloud-based, containerized, and frequently updated. A single vulnerability can be quickly exploited at scale. Security in DevSecOps:

* Reduces risks by detecting vulnerabilities early in CI/CD pipelines
* Prevents insecure code from reaching production
* Protects customer data and business assets
* Ensures compliance with security standards and regulations
* Enables faster, safer deployments through automation

### Impact of Security Breaches

Security breaches in a DevSecOps environment can have severe consequences:

* **Pipeline compromise** leading to malicious code in production
* **Data breaches** exposing sensitive user or business data
* **Service disruption** due to attacks on cloud or container infrastructure
* **Loss of trust** in applications and development teams
* **High remediation costs** and rollback delays
  Because DevSecOps systems are highly automated, a breach can spread rapidly if not controlled.
