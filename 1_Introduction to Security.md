## 1. Introduction to Security (DevSecOps Perspective)

- In **DevSecOps**, security is integrated into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) rather than being handled at the end. 
- The goal is to build **secure-by-design** applications by embedding security practices into development (Dev), operations (Ops), and automation pipelines.
- Security in DevSecOps focuses on identifying and fixing vulnerabilities early, using automated tools and continuous monitoring, while maintaining fast and reliable software delivery.
